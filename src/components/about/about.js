              Today REVA HACK has become our University's flagship technological
              event that welcomes over a thousand participants every year.
              Despite the pandemic over the last few years, REVA HACK has
              managed to adapt to the new norm by embracing the virtual
              hackathon model. This move in turn helped us expand our reach and
              welcome more participants in the past few years.
